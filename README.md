# Online Robust PCA
An implementation of online robust PCA (ORPCA) descripbed in the paper: 
* [Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5131-online-robust-pca-via-stochastic-optimization) by Feng et al. [NIPS 2013]     

However, it is modified slightly since missing data points cannot be reconstructed.

## Dataset
[VIRAT Video Dataset](https://viratdata.org) was used here (not in the paper), which is designed to be realistic, natural and challenging for video surveillance domains in terms of its resolution, background clutter, diversity in scenes, and human activity/event categories than existing action recognition datasets. It has become a benchmark dataset for the computer vision community.
